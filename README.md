# MadLibs
A Madlibs game where the user is initially prompted to choose a story. After they choose their story, they are prompted to enter keywords such as adjectives and nouns. The story of choice is then printed using the keywords that the user has entered. The program then asks the user if they would like to play again. If they say yes, they are returned to the story choice prompt, if they say no, the program ends.
